  "description": "\n\u003cp\u003eTest applications, packages, and libraries large and small with pytest, Python’s most powerful testing framework. pytest helps you write tests quickly and keep them readable and maintainable. In this fully revised edition, explore pytest’s superpowers—simple asserts, fixtures, parametrization, markers, and plugins—while creating simple tests and test suites against a small database application. Using a robust yet simple fixture model, it’s just as easy to write small tests with pytest as it is to scale up to complex functional testing. This book shows you how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epytest is undeniably the best choice for testing Python projects. It’s a full-featured, flexible, and extensible testing framework. pytest’s fixture model allows you to share test data and setup procedures across multiple layers of tests. The pytest framework gives you powerful features such as assert rewriting, parametrization, markers, plugins, parallel test execution, and clear test failure reporting—with no boilerplate code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith simple step-by-step instructions and sample code, this book gets you up to speed quickly on this easy-to-learn yet powerful tool. Write short, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you’re testing. Speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use Python’s built-in assert statements instead of awkward assert helper functions to make your tests more readable. Move setup code out of tests and into fixtures to separate setup failures from test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, and even existing unittest tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrite simple, maintainable tests quickly with pytest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Need\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe examples in this book were written using Python 3.10 and pytest 7. pytest 7 supports Python 3.5 and above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t",

  "description": "\n\u003cp\u003eWhether based on academic theories or discovered empirically by humans and machines, all financial models are at the mercy of modeling errors that can be mitigated but not eliminated. Probabilistic ML technologies are based on a simple and intuitive definition of probability and the rigorous calculus of probability theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike conventional AI systems, probabilistic machine learning (ML) systems treat errors and uncertainties as features, not bugs. They quantify uncertainty generated from inexact model inputs and outputs as probability distributions, not point estimates. Most importantly, these systems are capable of forewarning us when their inferences and predictions are no longer useful in the current market environment. These ML systems provide realistic support for financial decision-making and risk management in the face of uncertainty and incomplete information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbabilistic ML is the next generation ML framework and technology for AI-powered financial and investing systems for many reasons. They are generative ensembles that learn continually from small and noisy financial datasets while seamlessly enabling probabilistic inference, prediction and counterfactual reasoning. By moving away from flawed statistical methodologies (and a restrictive conventional view of probability as a limiting frequency), you can embrace an intuitive view of probability as logic within an axiomatic statistical framework that comprehensively and successfully quantifies uncertainty. This book shows you why and how to make that transition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Learn to use the Rails 7 tools and simplify the complex JavaScript ecosystem. It’s easier than ever to build user interactions with Hotwire, Turbo, and Stimulus. You can add great front-end flair without much extra complication. Use React to build a more complex set of client-side features. Structure your code for different levels of client-side needs with these powerful options. Add to your toolkit today!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 7 added a new set of default front-end building tools that are simpler to use and more robust than the previous defaults. This version of the book uses the jsbundling-rails gem and the esbuild library to manage JavaScript, the cssbundling-rails gem and Tailwind CSS to manage CSS, and the new Propshaft gem for asset management. Stimulus and Turbo have also upgraded and added a small number of new features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s hard to have a Rails application without integrating some client-side logic. But client-side coding tools, and the Rails tools for integrating with them, all change continuously. Rails 7 simplifies client-side integration with the Hotwire gem. It’s a great way to build client interaction with server-side HTML and a small amount of JavaScript.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the latest edition of this book, learn how to use Rails 7 and its front-end bundling tools to build rich front-end logic into your Rails applications. The job is even easier with Stimulus, a library that brings Rails conventions to JavaScript tools. And you can also add in React, a larger framework that automatically updates the browser when your data changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn the basics of Turbo, Stimulus, and TypeScript, and add pizazz to your application. Structure your web application to best manage your state. Learn how to interact with data on the server while still keeping the user experience interactive. Use the type system in TypeScript to expand on JavaScript and help prevent error conditions. Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of ways to do client-side coding, and Rails is here to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Need\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis book requires Ruby on Rails 7.0 or later, React 17.0.0 or later.

This book contains a thorough exploration of complex concepts and best practices to help you master the skills of designing and deploying large-scale distributed systems on Kubernetes clusters. You’ll learn how to run complex stateless and stateful microservices on Kubernetes, including advanced features such as horizontal pod autoscaling, rolling updates, resource quotas, and persistent storage backends. In addition, you’ll understand how to utilize serverless computing and service meshes. Further, two new chapters have been added. “Governing Kubernetes” covers the problem of policy management, how admission control addresses it, and how policy engines provide a powerful governance solution. “Running Kubernetes in Production” shows you what it takes to run Kubernetes at scale across multiple cloud providers, multiple geographical regions, and multiple clusters, and it also explains how to handle topics such as upgrades, capacity planning, dealing with cloud provider limits/quotas, and cost management. By the end of this Kubernetes book, you’ll have a strong understanding of, and hands-on experience with, a wide range of Kubernetes capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t",

This book will provide you with insights into the inner workings of the LLMs and guide you through creating your own language models. You’ll start with an introduction to the field of generative AI, helping you understand how these models are trained to generate new data. Next, you’ll explore use cases where ChatGPT can boost productivity and enhance creativity. You’ll learn how to get the best from your ChatGPT interactions by improving your prompt design and leveraging zero, one, and few-shots learning capabilities. The use cases are divided into clusters of marketers, researchers, and developers, which will help you apply what you learn in this book to your own challenges faster. You’ll also discover enterprise-level scenarios that leverage OpenAI models’ APIs available on Azure infrastructure; both generative models like GPT-3 and embedding models like Ada. For each scenario, you’ll find an end-to-end implementation with Python, using Streamlit as the frontend and the LangChain SDK to facilitate models’ integration into your applications. By the end of this book, you’ll be well equipped to use the generative AI field and start using ChatGPT and OpenAI models’ APIs in your own projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t",

  "description": "\n\u003cp\u003eSockets and Pipes is not an introduction to Haskell; it is an introduction to writing software in Haskell. Using a handful of everyday Haskell libraries, this book walks through reading the HTTP specification and implementing it to create a web server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Book\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe content that eventually grew into this book began with the question: What exactly is a web server? A satisfactory answer that does not assume substantial background knowledge requires spanning quite a few areas of computing. Fortunately, they all serve as fruitful motivations for simultaneously learning about how to use Haskell, which is the larger objective of the \u003cem\u003eJoy of Haskell\u003c/em\u003e collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe language a web server speaks is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which this book explores in great detail while walking through the creation of a server from “scratch.” We encourage readers to follow along in reading the official definition of HTTP (RFC 9110 and 9112 published by the Internet Engineering Task Force) as we implement the specification in Haskell. While high-level libraries make it possible to create web applications without detailed knowledge of HTTP, we believe that a full understanding of the underlying layers we build upon helps us use a platform more effectively. By studying HTTP we also gain an appreciation for what it is and is not good for, and for what applications we might stand to benefit from choosing a different network protocol instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrerequisites\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis book is for Haskell learners who have some basic faculty with the language and are now ready to work up to a substantial project. We expect that you understand the basic syntax and can do things like install GHC, use GHCi, write a case expression, sequence IO actions in a do block, use qualified imports, and define datatypes. From the base package, we assume some familiarity with Maybe, Either, [], Eq, Show, Monoid, Foldable, Functor, and Monad. We do not assume prior knowledge of any additional libraries or GHC language extensions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat’s inside\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBytes and characters\u003c/strong\u003e – The first several chapters introduce the bytestring and text libraries and are largely dedicated to tearing apart a traditional hello world program, looking underneath the abstract notion of “printing text” to start greeting the world in terms of writing bytes to a file handle. After discussing bytes, we need only a short hop to sockets, our means of writing bytes across great distances using the network library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEncoding and parsers\u003c/strong\u003e – First we encode HTTP messages as byte strings. That’s the easy part; next, we go in the opposite direction and learn how to interpret byte strings using the attoparsec library. This will acquaint us even more closely with the HTTP message format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonad transformers\u003c/strong\u003e – We introduce some monad transformers that are especially applicable to our subject matter: ResourceT, Producer, ExceptT, and ReaderT. No prior experience with transformers is required. We do not linger on the general concept, preferring instead to focus on each of the three examples and to create familiarity with transformers and lifting chiefly by demonstration. Later on, we use newtype wrappers and DerivingVia to manage the complexity of larger monad stacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResource safety\u003c/strong\u003e – Use of ResourceT begins in chapter 1, and we use it throughout the book. This makes it a breeze to deal with files and sockets without resource leaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStreaming\u003c/strong\u003e – To move past toy examples that fit easily into memory, we have to start writing streaming processes that can deal with large amounts of data by handling it in smaller pieces. All of the code within this book is written with memory usage in mind. Producer, Pipe, and Consumer constitute an especially convenient facility for working with streams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eError handling\u003c/strong\u003e – As features accumulate, the number of possible error conditions starts to rise. We introduce ExceptT to work with errors in a clean and well-typed manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t",

It’s just the information you need, just when you need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of this book, you’ll be a master of push notifications and well on your way to implementing them inside your own apps!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is this for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis book is for intermediate iOS developers who already know the basics of iOS, and who wish to know everything there is to know about push notifications.
